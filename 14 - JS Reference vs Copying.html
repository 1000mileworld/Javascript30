    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //200 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; //team is a reference, so both players and team updates

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
   

    // one way
 	const team2 = players.slice(); //make a copy of team2
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
	const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; //put every item in iterable into new array

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99}); //parameters: empty object, original object, property you want to overwrite
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};//implemented one day
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
    	name: 'Wes',
    	age: 100,
    	social:{
    		twitter: '@wesbos',
    		facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
    	}
    }
    
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({},wes);

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'; //changes wes.social.twitter as well

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //poor man's deep clone
    dev2.social.twitter = '@booyeah';
